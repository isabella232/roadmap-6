## FAQs
**Q: Why public roadmaps?**

A: We want to learn which features are the most important for the community and our customers and we want to show where we are with implementing the desired functionality.

**Q: Why are there no dates on your roadmap?**

A: Quality of our products is the top priority, we are careful with providing estimates for features. We might later add the labels to provide the ETAs.

**Q: Is everything on the roadmap?**

A: We track our development in our public [JIRA](https://jira.percona.com) and sync roadmap items manually. Something might slip. Please open the issue if you see that something is missing!

**Q: How can I request a feature be added to the roadmap?**

A: Please open an issue. Feature ideas will be tagged "Proposed" and will be reviewed by the team.
