## FAQs
**Q: Why public roadmaps?**

A: Users of our products can plan accordingly if they know what we are working on. Als we would love to know which features are the most wanted by the customers and the community.

**Q: Why are there no dates on your roadmap?**

A: Quality of our products is the top priority, we are careful with providing estimates for features. We might later add the labels to provide the ETAs.

**Q: Is everything on the roadmap?**

A: We track our development in our public [JIRA](https://jira.percona.com) and sync roadmap items manually. Something might slip. Please open the issue if you see that something is missing!

**Q: How can I request a feature be added to the roadmap?**

A: Please open an issue. Feature ideas will be tagged "Proposed" and will be reviewed by the team.
